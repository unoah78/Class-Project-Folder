# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis-SQL

## <ins>Overview</ins>

Bobby and I work in HR at Pewlett Hackards and have been tasked to create SQL database from six ***CSV files*** the company have collected of department, managers and employee data. Once databases have been built, we are then to provide the leadership whom all will be eligible for retirement and how many positions will need to be filled.

Below are a few of the tables that Bobby and I created using a variety of SQL functions and joins from the tables that were created from the ***CSV files***:

- Retirement Titles
- Unique Titles
- Retiring Titles
- Mentorship Eligibilty

The following data was presented to the head of HR to prepare for the slew of "Baby Boomers" that may be retiring in the future.
